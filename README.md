# Emmet Playground

A web app written with React, to try out the underused tool Emmet.

## Installation

The usual jazz.

```bash
yarn # or npm i
yarn start # run locally
yarn build # build for deployment
```

## Notes

- No tests, don't sue me.
- Originally made using CodeSandbox, but pulled away from there because the Git integration was buggy.
